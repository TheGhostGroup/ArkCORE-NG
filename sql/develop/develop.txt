how can we populate a map as vashjir with new content?
and do it with better overview, not update each change, as single update with date, as we do now,
but as one big zone
so it is more easy to import/export/maintenance data 

if someone has a better idee: our forum is: http://gpn39f.spdns.de/forum1
